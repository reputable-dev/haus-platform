#### For Real Estate Agents:

## ❓ FAQ Section

### **How is HAUS different from Domain or realestate.com.au?**
HAUS isn't just another property listing site. We combine AI-powered matching with exclusive off-market properties and 150+ app integrations. While traditional platforms show you everything, HAUS shows you only what matters to you—faster and more accurately than any other platform.

### **What makes your AI matching so accurate?**
Our AI doesn't just look at your search filters. It analyzes your behaviour: which properties you spend time viewing, what features you consistently bookmark, which suburbs you keep coming back to, and even the time of day you're most active. This creates a "preference DNA" that gets smarter with every interaction.

### **Are the off-market properties actually exclusive?**
Yes. We have partnerships with over 500 agents across Australia who list properties exclusively with HAUS before they hit the public market. These properties are genuinely not available on Domain, realestate.com.au, or any other platform.

### **How do the 150+ integrations work?**
HAUS connects with your existing apps and services through our partnership with Pica. Whether you want to save properties to Notion, get calendar reminders for inspections, sync with your CRM, or get mortgage estimates from your bank—HAUS adapts to your workflow instead of forcing you to adapt to ours.

### **Is there a mobile app?**
Yes! HAUS is available on iOS and Android, plus our web platform works on any device. All your data syncs seamlessly across platforms.

### **Can I cancel anytime?**
Absolutely. No contracts, no cancellation fees. You can upgrade, downgrade, or cancel anytime directly from your account dashboard.

### **How does the 30-day guarantee work?**
If you're not completely satisfied with HAUS Premium or Pro within your first 30 days, we'll refund your entire payment. Just email support@haus.com.au and we'll process your refund within 2 business days.

### **Do you cover all of Australia?**
Currently, HAUS covers 100+ suburbs across Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth, Adelaide, and Canberra, with 50,000+ properties. We're rapidly expanding to cover all major Australian metropolitan areas by Q2 2025.

### **Is my data secure?**
Security is our top priority. All data is encrypted in transit and at rest, stored in Australian data centres, and we never share your personal information with third parties without explicit consent. We're GDPR compliant and follow all Australian privacy regulations.
